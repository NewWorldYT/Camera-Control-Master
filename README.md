# Camera-Control-Master
A program created to control camera angles within games such as Gran Prix Legends, NASCAR Racing 2002 Season, NASCAR Racing 2003 Season &amp; etc. 

This program was originally created in 2001 for a game called Gran Prix Legends by Peter van der Burg. He was reached out to via email to 
grab the source code to update it for future versions of Windows. These are the email conversations between himself and Stefan. (the man who emailed 
him to get the source code from him)

IMPORTANT notes by Peter van der Burg on CCM

Hi Stefan,

Good to hear that people still work to improve Grand Prix Legends. I am not in any competition anymore but sometimes I grab the wheel and do some laps with Grand Prix Legends.

Unfortunately I really don't have time to do any development or investigation. I am also the developer of the AlbumPlayer ( www.albumplayer.com) which takes all my spare time. But maybe I can give you some tips that might help. I think the problem that it doesn't work is mostly because the user management that was introduced in Vista. First my advice to use only Win7 32bit. Second is run everything as Administrator, both Grand Prix Legends and CCM.

When I am home I will look what I have and I can send you all. Note that this is all developed with an older version of C++ Builder. That might be the hard part to get it. The sources are not very well documented because it was just a quick and dirty hobby project.

Maybe after all it is the most easy to get a PC and install XP on it.

Regards,
Peter

Hi Stefan,

I found the sources. If you like I can send it to you. First I want some agreement before sending (I trust you, but just to do things the right way). Please confirm the following:

1.    The GPLForever CCM or any derived software remains freeware
2.    The software is supplied as it is, and it is understood there will be no support
3.    Any further development will still reference to the original CCM
4.    Any person that receives these sources should first agree to these conditions before receiving the software.

Considering the support, you really must believe that I would love to help but I am so extremely busy, it is really not possible.

Please also try to follow the other advices I gave to use the original software. That would be by far the easiest way.

Regards,
Peter

Hi Stefan,

Here are the sources. There is an older version of C++ Builder necessary to build it (the project file probably tells which version, I don’t remember). I don’t know if it also works with the latest C++ Builder version.

Peter
